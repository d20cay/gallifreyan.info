		<h3>Feedback</h3>
		<p>
			As much as I love Gallifreyan I have very little time that I can invest into it due to
			work and my studies. I would really appreciate it if you could <a href="contact/">leave
			some feedback</a> if you have some time to spare.
		</p>

		<h3>Help</h3>
		<p>
			My dream for this website is that it could be used as the main repository of information
			on Gallifreyan. I would love if it was the main website artists would use as references
			when they're starting out. For the moment there is only one guide from the many dialects
			of Gallifreyan that exist, which I would like to change but sadly I have very little
			time I can spare. If you're interested in helping me by collaborating with me on new
			guides to some more dialects (see footer) <a href="contact/">let me know</a>!
