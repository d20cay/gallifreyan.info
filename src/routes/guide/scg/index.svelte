<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
	Gallifreyan is a made up writing system used by the Time Lords of Gallifrey, from the BBC series
	Doctor Who. This writing system was created by Loren Sherman and is free for anyone to use.
	Thanks a lot Loren!<br>
	This guide deals with Circular Gallifreyan. To clarify, this is not a language - it's just a way
	to write words and sentences in languages like English that use the latin alphabet.
</p>

<h2>The Alphabet</h2>

<h3>The Consonants</h3>
<div class="uk-child-width-expand@m" uk-grid>
	<div>
		<p>
			Each word has its own word circle, that the consonants attach to. This circle is called
			the word circle. {@html figRef(2)} shows the consonant stems and the additional
			modifiers.<br>
			One can refer to the stems by naming each stem by the first letter in the row. Thus, the
			uppermost stem is the b-stem, the second stem from the top the j-stem, and so on.
		</p>
		<p>
			The left-most column shows all the consonant stems. The upper-most row shows the
			decoration. These two combined form a consonant.
		</p>
	</div>
	<div>
		<Image src="img/guide/scg/letters/consonants.svg"
		       alt="Consonant table"
		       desc={`The ${lang} consonants`}
		       imageCounter={counter += 1}
		       annotateFigure={true}
		       addAnchor={true}/>
	</div>
</div>
<div class="uk-child-width-expand@m" uk-grid>
	<div>
		<p>
			{@html figRef(3)} is an example of how to apply all of the consonant stems
			from {@html figRef(2)} to a so-called word circle. {@html figRef(3)} does not really
			correspond to and english word, but spells out <q>bjtth</q>.
		</p>
	</div>
	<div>
		<Image src="img/guide/scg/letters/stems.svg"
		       alt="Consonant stems applied to a word circle"
		       desc={`All ${lang} consonant stems applied to a word circle`}
		       imageCounter={counter += 1}
		       annotateFigure={true}
		       addAnchor={true}/>
	</div>
</div>

<h3>The Vowels</h3>
<p>
	In Circular Gallifreyan you attach your vowels to the consonant which came before the vowel
	whenever possible. If the first letter of a word is a vowel, you can write the vowel without a
	consonant preceding it. Separating a vowel from its preceding consonant can also be done to
	improve visual appearance.
</p>
<div class="uk-child-width-expand@m" uk-grid>
	<div>
		<p>
			The curved black path represents a fragment of a word circle. Don't worry, we will take
			a look at these very soon. The grey circles are the<q>th-stems</q>, as seen
			in {@html figRef(2)}. The most important part are the violet elements. These are the
			vowels which are attached to their preceding consonant, here always <q>th</q>.
			This again, is not an English word; it spells out <q>thathethithothu</q>.
		</p>
		<Image src="img/guide/scg/letters/vowels.svg"
		       alt="Vowels"
		       desc="All vowels attached to part of a word circle"
		       imageCounter={counter += 1}
		       annotateFigure={true}
		       addAnchor={true}/>
	</div>
	<div>
		<p>
			In {@html figRef(3)} you saw all of the consonant stems applied to a word circle. In
			this figure I have added the vowels so that you have an idea where to put the vowels on
			the preceding consonant. The violet objects are the vowels.
		</p>
		<p>
			These words would spell out (left to right, top to bottom) <q>bajatatha</q>,
			<q>bojototho</q>, <q>bijitithi</q>, <q>bujututhu</q> and <q>bojototho</q>.
		</p>
		<Image src="img/guide/scg/letters/stems-vowels.svg"
		       alt="Vowels on consonant stems"
		       desc="All vowels attached to each of the consonant stems"
		       imageCounter={counter += 1}
		       annotateFigure={true}
		       addAnchor={true}/>
	</div>
</div>

<h2>The Words</h2>

<p>
	To read a word in Gallifreyan, start with the letter that is the furthest at the bottom of the
	word circle, then read counterclockwise. Letâ€™s write some example words.
</p>
<p>Flip through the images elements to see how to build a word.</p>

<h3>Doctor</h3>

			<p>
				To construct the first letter of our word (<q>Doctor</q>), we draw the <q>b-stem</q>,
				which is a big divot. Then we attach three dots. We choose that stem and decoration
				because that is where the <q>d</q> lies in the consonant table. The dots can
				be
				placed anywhere, and can be as large or small as you wish, as long as as it's clear
				that
				they belong to the <q>b-stem</q>.
			</p>

			       annotateFigure={true}

			<p>
				Let's first write each letter by themselves and then attach them to the previous
				letters. We just add the letter <q>o</q> as it's used in {@html figRef(4)}.
			</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<h4>Do</h4>
			<Image src={wordParts.do.src}
			       alt={altFromDesc(wordParts.do.desc, wordParts.do.lang)}

			       imageCounter={counter += 1}
			       annotateFigure={true}
			       addAnchor={true}/>
			<p>
				{@html figRef(5)} shows us how to combine the <q>b-stem</q>, which was used to
				create <q>d</q> ({@html figRef(6)}), with the vowel <q>o</q>
				({@html figRef(7)}), to form <q>do</q>. As long as it conforms with the rules
				of the vowel, we could put it anywhere. Use the placement to create a unique version
				of your design!

			       annotateFigure={true}
			       addAnchor={true}/>
			<p>
				The <q>c</q> is tricky. As can see if you check the consonant table above, the
				<q>c</q> is greyed out, that's intentional. You are only supposed to use the
				<q>c</q> , and <q>q</q> that is also greyed out, in proper names.
				Instead use their phonetic equivalents <q>s</q> and <q>k</q>. We are
				trying to achieve the sound of a <q>k</q> so we will use the
				<q>j-stem</q> with two dots.
			</p>

			<h4>Dok</h4>

			       imageCounter={counter += 1}
			       annotateFigure={true}
			       addAnchor={true}/>
			<p>
				Since words are read counterclockwise, we add the <q>c</q> in counterclockwise
				direction from <q>do</q>.

		<li>
			<h4>T</h4>
			<Image src={wordParts.t.src}
			       alt={altFromDesc(wordParts.t.desc, wordParts.t.lang)}

			       imageCounter={counter += 1}
			       annotateFigure={true}
			       addAnchor={true}/>
			<p>
				Now we need a <q>t</q>, so we just use the <q>t-stem</q> without any
				decoration.
			</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<h4>Dokt</h4>
			<Image src={wordParts.doct.src}

<h2>The Sentences</h2>

<div uk-grid>
	<div class="uk-width-1-3@m">
		<p>
			Words are good alright, but sentences are even better! Like words, they're read
			counterclockwise starting from the bottom. The letters <q>T</q>,
			<q>WH</q>,<q>SH</q>, <q>R</q>, <q>V</q>, <q>W</q> and
			<q>S</q> can be used to interconnect letters by interlocking them. This convention
			exists purely to improve visual appearance. It gives a sentence more coherence. The
			words in {@html figRef(28)} say <q>Bow ties are cool</q>.

			Next we'll add two circles around all of the words. The inner circle has multiple divots
			to fill the space that the letter circles don't cover. This helps eliminate dead space,
			is purely aesthetic and doesn't change the meaning at all. The outer circle is a little
			bit bigger than the inner one and has no divots, unless there is more than one sentence,
			but we'll get to that later.
		</p>
		<p>
			Now itâ€™s time to extend the lines. For the meaning of any one letter, all that matters
			is that the right number of lines terminate at that letter. It doesn't matter to which
			other object these lines connect.<br>One exception is that the lines from the letters
			<q>i</q> and <q>u</q>should face in the approximately right direction. E.g.
			a line starting out from the letter <q>i</q> must roughly go inwards and a line
			starting out from the letter <q>u</q> must rougly go outwards. Lines can be used
			to create an even better appearance of harmony by interconnecting.

	In {@html figRef(29)} there are two sentence circles. The inner sentence circle, with the
	divots, and the outer sentence circle which just wraps everything up. The punctuation of a
	sentence is always placed on the inner sentence circle. The <q>?</q>, <q>!</q> and
	<q>;</q> can be situated on the inside or outside of the inner circle. All other
	punctuation marks should stay on the inner circle.<br>The <q>'</q> is a special case. The
	two lines that designate an <q>'</q>, must not start on the inner circle and end on the
	outer circle. Instead they must start or end in between the two letter/consonant stems, and
	start/end on the inner sentence circle. The following examples show good and bad practice.

<h3>Connected Sentences</h3>
<div uk-grid>
	<div class="uk-width-3-4@m">
		Sentences are connected by interlocking them with the use of the divots on the inner
		sentence circle. In this way the sentences form chains like shown in {@html figRef(33)}.
		These chains are generally read from left to right, but you might want to add your own
		touch and rearrange them differently. The order of the sentences should at least be
		guessable from context.
	</div>
	<div class="uk-width-1-4@m">

		       alt={altFromDesc(sentences.fearHate.desc, sentences.fearHate.lang)}
		       desc={captionFromDesc(sentences.fearHate.desc, sentences.fearHate.lang)}
		       imageCounter={counter += 1}
		       annotateFigure={true}

<h2>The Numbers</h2>

<div class="uk-child-width-1-2@m" uk-grid>
	<div>
		<p>
			Numbers can be written as concentric circles. The area between two adjacent circles is
			called a ring and represents a digit. The number of lines inside a ring specifies the
			value of that digit. Small circles inscribed into a ring denote the value of five. The
			numbers in {@html figRef(34)} and {@html figRef(35)} are <q>1048</q> and <q>-13.37</q>.
		</p>
		<p>
			Numbers are read from the outermost to the innermost ring. If one circle is thicker than
			the others, it specifies the decimal point. If there is no thickest circle, the number
			is not a decimal number. Negative numbers are recognisable by a line that is drawn
			across the innermost circle.

<h2>FAQ</h2>

<dl class="uk-description-list">
	<dt>I'm not sure I understand how to read/write Gallifreyan. Do you have some more designs where
		I can practice?
	</dt>
	<dd>
		I sure do. Just head on over to <a href="designs/">gallifreyan.info/designs</a> and take a
		look at those. Don't look at the page and try to blindly click on an image. It will enlarge
		the image and hide the caption. Now you can try to read what it says and look at the caption
		once you think you have the right answer. If you are ready to start writing Gallifreyan,
		read one of the captions without looking at the design too much, make your own design and
		then check what I made to compare them.

	<dt>What editor an you recommend to start writing SCG?</dt>
	<dd>
		A popular and free choice is to write Circular Gallifreyan
		is <a href="https://inkscape.org/">Inkscape</a>. However <a href="https://inkscape.org/">Inkscape</a>
		is quite advanced and hard to get into. To get started I can recommend the free version of
		<a href="https://www.designer.io/">Gravit Designer</a>. Because of how
		<a href="https://www.designer.io/">Gravit Designer</a> is written you might have a hard
		time stretching your legs and getting more creative with your designs so it might be a good
		idea to start looking for something more suitable at that point.<br>
		Personally I use <a href="https://affinity.serif.com/en-us/designer/">Affinity Designer</a>because
		it's only a one-time payment and it gives me all I need. Some people that don't feel
		comfortable switching also write Gallifreyan in
		<a href="https://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop.html">Photoshop</a>.

	<dd>
		Either make the line which originates from the <q>U</q> circle back to the word
